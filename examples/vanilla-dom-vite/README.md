# Example: remote-ui using the DOM and vitejs

This example shows how you can use remote-ui to implement off-main-thread rendering using just the DOM.

The app uses [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and imports the local in-repo version of `@remote-ui` packages which makes a great app to develop changes in these packages with.

## Usage

Run `yarn example:vanilla-dom-vite` in the root folder of this repo.
